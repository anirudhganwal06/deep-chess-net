# Deep Chess Net
After learning some fundamentals of deep learning, I came across a very interesting paper [DeepChess](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/papers/deepchess.pdf) which tends to give a competition to a Human Chess Grandmaster. I decided to give its implementation a try using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

##### Note
- At the course of the development of this deep-chess-net, I also published a [PyPI](https://pypi.org) project [pgn2bitboard](https://pypi.org/project/pgn2bitboard) that converts a collection of games in PGN format into bitboards and labels.
